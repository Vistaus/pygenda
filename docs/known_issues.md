Known Issues
============
A list of known bugs in, and to-dos for, Pygenda.

This is in-development code, released for testing and feedback. As
such there are many major features still to add, as well as numerous
bugs. This is a (certainly incomplete) list to help keep track of
these issues.

Note also, that the code is released as-is and there is no guarantee
of any sort.

Major
-----
* Missing views: Day, List, Anniversary, Busy.
  (Also, a Month View, e.g. https://www.rmrsoft.com/epoc/month.htm )

* Setting alarms is under development. See [Usage.md](Usage.md) for
  current details. (Note: a separate alarm program should handle the
  actual alarm notifications.)

* Several event properties are not implemented (attendees, url,
  user tags, attachments, etc.)

* Many todo item properties are not implemented (start date, user tags,
  timed-but-undated (use daily repeating?), etc.)

* Todo items can only be sorted by priority - add sort by duedate,
  by status, manual...

* Repeated event UI missing many elements (more complete repeat by
  BYMONTHDAY, BYSETPOS, Monday & Wednesday every week, first weekday
  of month, extra dates, hourly/minutely/secondly repeats).
  See: https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-3-10-recurrence-rule.html
  Doesn't handle repeat by RDATE at all.
  See: https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-8-5-2-recurrence-date-times.html

* Editing exception dates not very clean. E.g. can add "exceptions"
  that are not part of the repeat run, and they are saved without
  problem, and not highlighted in UI as problematic in any way;
  dates can be added that are not visible because box doesn't scroll
  to newly added date; events can be made invisible (thus uneditable)
  by making all occurrences exceptions; keyboard navigation in menu
  is not intuitive.

* Multi-day events (i.e. ones that span multiple days) only displayed
  on first day. (In progress - started on Week View.) (Future: config
  option "next_day_crossover" to determine if an even crosses over.)

* Cutting repeating events is not implemented. (Not sure how to do UI -
  probably need to bring up a dialog "Cut just this occurrence, or all
  repeats?". That then raises question about behaviour when copying
  repeating events, where currently just one occurrence is copied. See
  also deleting repeated events - currently all repeats are deleted.)

* Creating/updating new entries in large calendars is unusably slow.
  (In tests, with .ics file, file writing is slow; with CalDAV server
  re-sorting the lists is slow.)

* "Find" function is rudimentary/placeholder (no options, just searches
  for full string, only searches in the Summary, can't jump to entries
  from results, not progressive, order of results is not useful, ...)

* No "Import" function (e.g. to import iCal events from an email).
  Also, how do we share events - "export"?

* Only one calendar source can be used at a time. (Maybe allow multiple
  CalDAV calendars, each with own style element, so can be coloured
  differently by CSS. No support for multiple .ics files?)

Medium
------
* How to handle setting the status of a repeating event? (E.g., a
  reasonable use-case would be to cancel just one occurrence of a
  repeating event. How is this done with ical?)

* Need InfoPrints (a.k.a. toast notifications) for some situations

* Todo items cannot be shown in Week or Year views

* Todo due-dates display improvements: date without year; date with day;
  date like "tomorrow", "today", "2 days", "yesterday!"; don't show if
  completed/cancelled; formatting for today/overdue items.

* When deleting a repeated event, all are deleted. Should offer option
  of deleting this one (better, also offer delete all from, all before...)

* No goto next/previous entry (for those without endless appointments)

* No time-zone support (should at least be part of time widget)
  (Options: "Travels with me" (default), zone xxx (list local first))

* No GUI for configuration settings/preferences

* Only French & English translations are provided (and the French needs
  checking by a native speaker).

* Setting number of days for "all day" events could be friendlier
  (e.g. show/set end date)

* Timed events can't last more than 24 hours (need to augment duration widget)

* No support for encryption/password protected entries

* Currently, if using CalDAV server & the connection fails (e.g. server
  halted), Pygenda just exits. Unclear what the best course is. To review
  later. (In "delete event" scenario, an error message & event remains
  probably good behaviour.)

* Ctrl+z does not work to undo in text entry fields. (Surprisingly, GTK3
  does not take care of this. Need to wait for GTK4? Port to QT??)

* An undo/redo function would be useful

* Copying/cutting entries doesn't work on all platforms. This functionality
  relies on a small C library, due to limits of Python GObject module.
  Builds on my devices and on Gemini. Needs looking at for other Linux
  distributions and Windows/MacOS.

* Softkeys should be user-customisable

* Date/time widgets are not easy to click (tap) on since most of the area
  does not respond to mouse clicks

* On Psion Agenda, could specify letter to use for display in Year view.
  Maybe add similar functionality by allowing user to add a Category
  https://icalendar.org/iCalendar-RFC-5545/3-8-1-2-categories.html
  This would add a "category_xxx" style to element, and css can be
  used to style these as wanted (user-supplied css).

* Potential optimisations when drawing Year View, which might make it
  quicker when going from year to year. (See comments in source for
  thoughts.)

* Some repeat types are slow to calculate (fallback types, e.g. by day
  in year - see messages on the console). Several options to speed
  this up: custom iterators, or add "shortcuts" (e.g. if repeat is on
  Wednesdays, but retrieving events for a Sunday, check early to skip
  most of the calculations).
  Currently uses dateutil.rrule to calculate most complex repeats,
  see: https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html
  Check if using recurring-ical-events module could improve speed??
  See: https://pypi.org/project/recurring-ical-events/

* Startup is slow on Gemini. Possible optimisation: run independent
  tasks asynchronously.

* If calendar data is updated externally while Pygenda is runing (e.g.
  another instance of Pygenda, or some other app, updates database)
  the changes are not detected/displayed.

* In Event dialog, repeats until/occurrences. Until date can be wrong if
  occurrences very high; occurrences can be wrong if date in far future.

* "Today" marked in views is not updated if day changes (e.g. midnight
  crossover, switch on device in new day, device time(zone) changed).

* For calendars saved in .ics file. Copy/pasting an event with a timezone
  to a date with a different DST, time displayed (local time) is an hour
  off. This fixes itself if Pygenda is restarted (so .ics file is re-read).
  Probable cause: In new_entry_from_example(), tzinfo of event includes
  timezone name ('Europe/London' etc) and utc offset. When new time is
  calculated it uses utc offset, but stores the timezone name. Hence
  initial display is incorrect, but when event is re-parsed it uses
  the timezone name and re-does calculation of utc offset, so time
  is now correct. This doesn't happen with CalDAV server, because in
  CalendarConnectorCalDAV::add_entry() it re-creates a new ics entry
  and (crucially) parses it, which gives the correct time.

* It would be better if the device was detected automatically at launch
  and the appropriate CSS loaded, rather than the user having to setup
  a user CSS to import the appropriate device CSS. (Before doing this,
  we should test on, and have CSS for, more than two platforms.)

* It's sometimes easy to accidentally cancel edits to an entry. One
  possible factor is that up/down navigation in the dialog by default
  takes the focus to the Cancel button. Maybe add a "Discard changes?"
  dialog if changes have been made and editing is cancelled.

Minor
-----
(Note: minor bugs can still be irritating!)

* After creating/editing a repeating event, cursor not always on that event

* Todo View navigation refinements: left/right can sometimes make the cursor
  move to an unexpected entry (need to find a better algorithm); if there
  is a border/margin/padding, up/down navigation not obviously at start/end.

* Would be nice to be able to edit dates with a calendar interface
  (Like pressing tab in S5)

* Week view: no touchscreen way to go forward/back a week (use swipe??)

* Ctrl+Left-Shift+X/C/V/N don't work on Gemini (UI eats keypress?)
  Workaround: Use Right-Shift.

* Anniversary event year (e.g. "20 years") not displayed (they're
  just annual repeats). (Maybe add category "Anniversary"?)

* Event dialog needs some indication if tab contents are non-default
  (e.g. if there are repeats, alarms - maybe show a tick in the tab handle)

* No user feedback for some actions (e.g. copy entry). Should flash or
  recolour cursor or something.

* Menu shortcuts set in glade are not translated (e.g. aller Ã  = ctrl+g)

* If using a .ics file and multiple instances edit the same file, data
  can be lost (note: using .ics file is not recommended => minor)

* In comboboxes, when in "popped out" state, +/-/</> keys don't work

* In the Entry Properties dialog, some properties are missing (attendees),
  and dates aren't localised

* In untranslated languages, there can be some awkward mixing of languages
  of fixed and generated content (e.g. "2. to last Sonntag of month")

* Newline behaviour in the Notes field in Event and Todo dialogs is not
  user-friendly. Possible improvements: display a note in the field when it
  is empty; a config option to swap with/without-modifier behaviours.

* There are accelerators to go to Time/Repeats/Alarm... subtabs for Event
  editing. The same should exist for Todo editing.

* In code, various places marked with '!!' indicating known bugs or
  temporary/placeholder implementations.

Cosmetic
--------
* If the first event edited after starting Pygenda has multiple exception
  dates, then it makes room for these in the Event dialog Repeats tab.
  This means that the Event dialog is made wide, and stays that way
  until Pygenda is restarted.

* In Event dialog, "Repeat on" combobox can change width when date is
  changed (due to expanding to contain longer strings - it stops once
  maximum width has been reached).

* Year View: Pixel missing in grid lines at top-left corner

* If Todo View is initial view, the vertical separator is not shown until
  there is a redraw.

* On Gemini, shows "no access" icons in instead of "minus" icons (e.g. in
  spin buttons of Event dialog) - Gemian bug?

* Year view is slow to redraw on Gemini, so get black rectangles when
  e.g. closing dialogs.

* Startup spinner is a bit glitchy (visible for large calendars).

* In Event dialog, Repeats tab, "Repeat until" label doesn't seem to align
  quite correctly with the field content.

* In Event and Todo dialogs, in Notes field, the scrollbar does not go to
  the border: there is a 1-pixel gap.

Testing
-------
* Need to test that iCal files/data can be read by other applications and
  Pygenda can read files/data from other applications.

* Need to expand unit testing (currently just test_repeats.py) and other
  tests (currently just manually checking a few test*.ics files).

* Need to test with corrupt iCal files. (Including when files become
  corrupt while the program is running.) Use a fuzzer?
  ? https://pypi.org/project/pythonfuzz/

* Need more complete checking from type annotations, so `mypy .` gives
  useful results.
